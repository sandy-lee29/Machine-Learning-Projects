1. Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews
   
In this project, I used a hybrid NLP approach to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. I extracted contextual embeddings using the pre-trained MiniLM model and fed them into a Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier for supervised learning. This combination allowed for efficient and accurate sentiment classification, demonstrating the power of integrating modern Transformer-based models with traditional machine learning.
