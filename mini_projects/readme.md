This repository showcases data science and machine learning projects as educational examples of workflows applied to real-world problems.

Below are the included projects:

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction
- A project focusing on predicting heart attack risk through data cleaning, feature engineering, Decision Tree Classifier training, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and interpretation of results.
- Key techniques include splitting blood pressure into systolic and diastolic values, encoding categorical variables, and identifying the most important features using feature importance.
- Insights into preventive healthcare strategies and model limitations are also discussed.

### 2. Predicting Coupon Acceptance with Machine Learning
- Predicted coupon acceptance using the In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation dataset and CatBoost Classifier.
- Implemented data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and reducing multicollinearity.
- Conducted model comparison, selecting CatBoost for its high Recall (0.836) and ROC AUC (0.834).
- Derived business insights from feature importance, such as tailoring coupon types, location-based offers, and optimizing expiration durations.
