This repository showcases data science and machine learning projects as educational examples of workflows applied to real-world problems.

Below are the included projects:

### 1. Heart Attack Risk Prediction
- A project focusing on predicting heart attack risk through data cleaning, feature engineering, Decision Tree Classifier training, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and interpretation of results.
- Key techniques include splitting blood pressure into systolic and diastolic values, encoding categorical variables, and identifying the most important features using feature importance.
- Insights into preventive healthcare strategies and model limitations are also discussed.
