# Machine Learning Projects

### Unsupervised Learning : Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering 

1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering: Iris dataset (from Seaborn), Wine dataset (from Scikit-learn)

2. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP): Digits dataset (from Scikit-learn)

### Supervised Learning : Classification & Regression

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): [Classification] Diabetes dataset (from Seaborn)   [Regression] Iris dataset

2. Evaluating Classification Models with Confusion Matrix :
   - KNN Classification : Breast Cancer datset (from Scikit-learn),
   - Logistic Regression : Penguins dataset (from Seaborn)

3. Linear Regression : California Housing dataset (from Scikit-learn)

### Decision Trees : Dealing with Non-linearity

1. Decision Tree Classifier: Boston Housing Price dataset (from Github)

2. Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree Regressor: Taxis dataset (from Seaborn)

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

1. Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews : Classified IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2) and a Histogram Gradient Boosting Classifier (IMDB Reviews dataset)

2. Music Genre Similarity Analysis : Analyzed music genre relationships using SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2), UMAP, and cosine similarity (Wikidata's music genre dataset)
